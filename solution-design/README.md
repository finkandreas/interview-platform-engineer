Current situation:
  - Users apply for nodehours on our machines and can submit jobs through SLURM on a vCluster
  - Actual consumed nodehours are billed to the user account
  - There is a database with the information of allocated and used nodehours

New situation:
  - Users get also access to a K8s cluster
You are given the task to integrate nodehour accounting. How would you proceed?
